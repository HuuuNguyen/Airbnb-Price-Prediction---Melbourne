# Airbnb Listing Price Prediction – Melbourne

This project was developed as part of a Master of Business Analytics group assignment, where students participated in a Kaggle competition to predict Airbnb listing prices in Melbourne. The work involved cleaning the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building regression models to forecast prices. Each student was responsible for one of the three defined tasks.

---

## 1. Objective

To create a predictive model that estimates Airbnb prices based on listing characteristics, with the goal of helping hosts set fair and competitive pricing.

---

## 2. Assignment Structure

The project was divided into three tasks:

- **Task 1 – Problem Description & Initial Data Analysis**  
  Defined the forecasting problem and analyzed the raw dataset  

- **Task 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Performed visual analysis and explored variable relationships  

- **Task 3 – Regression Modeling & Forecasting**  
  Built machine learning models and generated final predictions

---

## 3. Methodology

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed missing values and outliers
- **EDA**: Explored distribution of prices, availability, and geographic patterns
- **Feature Engineering**: One-hot encoding, feature selection
- **Modeling**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- **Evaluation Metric**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

---

## 4. Key Findings

- Suburb, room type, and availability were top predictors
- XGBoost performed best overall
- Log-transforming the target variable helped reduce skew and improve predictions

---

## 5. Learning Outcomes

- Built a complete ML pipeline using Python and Jupyter
- Gained hands-on experience in EDA, modeling, and evaluation
- Practiced collaborative workflow and reproducible code writing
